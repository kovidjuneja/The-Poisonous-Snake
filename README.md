The_Poisonous_Snake_Game, a timeless arcade game that challenges players to control a snake as it navigates through a grid, consuming food and growing in length while avoiding collisions with itself and the boundaries of the game area. The goal is to create a functional, engaging, and visually appealing version of the game using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
